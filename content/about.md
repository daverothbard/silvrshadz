This is a site about seeing — about the daily practice of looking at the world with enough attention that sometimes it looks back.

The photographs here are taken in the places I live, work, and travel through. They are not arranged to tell a single story. They are, instead, a personal record — an accumulation of moments where something in the light, or the geometry, or the presence of a stranger caught my eye long enough to make a picture.

All photographs by David Rothbard.
