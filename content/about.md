## Documenting My Vision of the World

Silvrshadz Reflections is an experiment in observation and recollection. It's a web site about seeing the world that I inhabit from my own point-of-view. When I see something that captures my attention, I want to share it with those that may be interested. On some days subjects will be totally unique. On others I may re-explore a subject I have seen before. It's important to me that I have a record of the world I continue to experience. It's a beautiful world and I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to experience it in my own way.

I have been fascinated with photography since I was 7 years old. Most of my education was through the act of shooting pictures on my own. However, I have dabbled in more formal learning over the years. I took photography classes in middle school, took pictures for my high school paper for 3 years as sports editor, was a photography student at the Corcoran College of Art and Design, took photo classes at the Alexandria Art League, and have provided corporate photography work for multiple companies. I even had my own photo business for a short time. I gave up the for-profit enterprise, though, because it took away from the joy of something that has largely been a hobby for most of my life.

For those curious as to how I am recording it, I am currently photographing with a Fujifilm X-T5. The lenses I'm currently using are the Tamron 18-300mm and the Fuji 23mm f/2.8. Many of these photos were shot with a wide range of Fuji, Tamron, and Viltrox lenses over the years. I started my journey over four decades ago with a Pentax M-EF and graduated to a Nikon N90s a few years before the digital era. I started my digital journey with a series of Nikons before venturing into the Fujifilm realm almost a decade ago. As much as I have enjoyed learning new cameras and lenses, it's always been about the seeing. In the end, I'll use any tool that helps me translate my vision to the final image.

Hopefully you find some joy in the images I share!
